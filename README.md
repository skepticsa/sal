# Software Abstraction Layer (SAL)

This is work in progress. The code needs to be upgraded from using Visual Studio 2005 to Visual Studio 2019.

The old documentatyion is in the "_SAL Microsoft Architecture - Danut.doc" file.

----------

Summary: The N-tier architecture has been with us for many years. It had helped us separate the Presentation Tier from the Business Tier and that in turn from the Data Tier. It provides a higher degree of decoupling when compared to the old 1 or 2-tier architecture. While the N-tier architecture is helping us make the applications more flexible and easier to change there is still an important potential for coupling between the different technologies and logical layers that exist in each physical tier.

This work identifies the points of coupling and proposes a solution that will increase the separation of concerns. This will allow the N-tier applications to be easier to change. While the article is using the .NET technologies and the C# language to make the point, the solutions can apply to other platforms and languages as well.

We will also provide a proof of concept prototype that will illustrate the points we are trying to make.
